### For recruiters!

Thank you for reading my portfolio.
Here are two projects that showcase my research and technical skills:

- [interferometry_clean_sim](https://github.com/skrbcr/interferometry_clean_sim): A research-based project where I implemented a simulation of an astronomical data processing algorithm called `CLEAN`. I developed this by studying academic papers on this algorithm.
- [Hopfield_network_gpu](https://github.com/skrbcr/Hopfield_network_gpu): A personal project experimenting with the Hopfield network model, a foundational neural network concept recognized by the Nobel Prize in Physics 2024.
